This UI repository is an essential component of the overall project, as it will enable users to interact with the various features of the platform.

# Personas of GamerLand

The following personas have been identified as key users of GamerLand:

- Gamers who are interested in discovering new games and want to read reviews and ratings from other users before purchasing a game.
- Gamers who want to connect with other users who share similar interests and participate in discussions about gaming.

# Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The rest will form the backlog.

# Game Search (MVP 1)

The Game Search feature is essential to solving the issue of fragmentation in the video game industry by providing a unified platform for users to search and discover games across different consoles and publishers. Users can filter and sort games by various criteria such as title, characters, genre, gaming console, and even user ratings. This feature reduces the need for users to navigate multiple websites or platforms to find the games they want to play.

# My Ratings & Reviews (MVP 2a) and Community Ratings & Reviews (MVP 2b)

The My Ratings & Reviews and Community Ratings & Reviews features allow users to share their experiences and opinions about games with others. Personalization and preferences will be available for users and will allow them to privatize certain lists, ratings, and reviews, or make them public to the GamerLand community of users. By providing a feedback mechanism for users, these features help users make informed decisions about which games to play and increase user engagement on the platform.

# User Profiles (MVP 3)

The User Profiles feature allows users to create a profile on the platform, where they can add information about themselves and their gaming preferences. Users can follow other users and view their profiles, as well as see their ratings and reviews of games. This feature is an essential component of the Connect category of GamerLand.
